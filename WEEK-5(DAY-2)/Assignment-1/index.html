    <p>
        This is my first paragraph in my new webpage.
        This is going to be great. I am so excited I can
        hardly contain myself. Don't you just love paragraphs?
        I find them very useful.

    <h2>Web Pages Are Exciting Too</h2>

    <p>
        Yes, that's right - web pages can be a lot of fun.
        Learning how to create web pages is easy and entertaining.
        This is my second paragraph. I hope you like it.

                    You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand.
                    Don't worry kiddo, when there's demand then there will be supply;
                    we'll all have our roads.

                    If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies,
                    demanded that you and your neighbors give me a percentage of
                    your income, in return for some crappy monopolized services
                    that you didn't ask for, would you consider that theft?

                    Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can
                    protect their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated
                    with the highest respect.
